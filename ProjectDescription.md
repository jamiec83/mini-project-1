The utilization of Git and Docker are a prime example of using modern tool's to get ahead. Git is a fantastic way to track the progression of code when trying to form a new idea or project. It can create a roadmap to success in what you are trying to achieve. Tracking changes in software development is vital to see what, how, and why something went wrong, or how you can make something more efficient. Automated testing is a tool that can go hand in hand with the usage of Git to maximize it's potential.

### Git commands and terminology

**Repository-**
*is a virtual storegage of your project. It allows you to save versions of your code, which you can access when needed.**


**Clone -**
*git clone is used to create a copy or clone of remote repositories. You pass git clone a repository URL. Git supports a few different network protocols and corresponding URL formats. Once a developer has obtained a working copy, all version control operations are managed through their local repository.*

**Fork -**
*A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Mac Windows Linux All. Most commonly,forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.*

**Branch -**
*Branch - A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes.*

**Commit -**
*A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it, it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.*

A fundamental understanding to terminal and Linux commands is crucial for success when trying to use Git or Github. The following commands are crucial to success:

* CD  - CD known as change directory is important to go from file to file or directory to directory as you would clicking on Mac or Windows. Using /cd *name* you can change to a location such as what would be your personal folder like /user/jamie/pictures.
* MKDIR - - MKDIR is used to create a new directory similar to how you would create a folder in Windows or Mac. If you wish to do so, you would use mkdir *name* to create what would be a new area if you wanted to organize workspace or keep files seperate from one-another.
* CP - CP stands as a form of copy for files. You can use cp *file* *new file* to duplicate an existing file. This is useful to save time in duplicating already existing files.
* PWD - This command serves as a way to print the working directory to identify the location of a file, folder, etc. You can use pwd -l for a symbolic path or pwd -p for an actual path. 
* MV - MV is used to move files from one directory to another. It can also be used to rename informaiton. You can use mv *file* *new file name*.
* RM - RM is used to remove objects whether they are files or directories. You can use rm *file or directory name* to remove any unwanted information.
* History - History is crucial to documenting changes to a given document as it outlines commands that were used depending on what you are viewing. You can use history to view this information.
* Home Directory - The home directory is used to act as a repository for a given logged in user. It acts in the way GitHub does to house a user's data in one given place that can be navigated or edited to create new data.

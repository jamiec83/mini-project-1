A fundamental understanding to terminal and Linux commands is crucial for success when trying to use Git or Github. The following commands are crucial to success:

* CD - CD known as change directory is important to go from file to file or directory to directory as you would clicking on Mac or Windows. Using /cd *name* you can change to a location such as what would be your personal folder like /user/jamie/pictures.
* MKDIR - - MKDIR is used to create a new directory similar to how you would create a folder in Windows or Mac. If you wish to do so, you would use mkdir *name* to create what would be a new area if you wanted to organize workspace or keep files seperate from one-another.
